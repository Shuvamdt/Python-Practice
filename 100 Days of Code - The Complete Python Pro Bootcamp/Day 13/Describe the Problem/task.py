# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
#for loop is lopping from 1 to 20 excluding 20
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
#when i = 20 it will print the line
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
#i will never reach 20
